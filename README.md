# Free Learn

This is a community where people can share skills for free. Contributors can share the skills they know to help anyone learn the skills they need both professionally and personally.

## Are you tired of needing to pay to learn new skills?

In a world that seeks to continuously monetize nearly everything, it can be frustrating to try to change careers, especially when so many resources ask you to spend money for the privilege to learn. This can lead people to spending money they would rather save, or even worse, taking out loans that will keep them trapped in the money trap. It's an unfortunately predatory system that needs to end.

Free Learn seeks to empower learners to learn the skills they need ***completely free***. No payments. No obligations. You can jump right in and begin learning what you need to. With Free Learn, you can:

- Learn in-demand skills for the industry you wish to break into
- Build projects that you can add to your portfolio to show potential employers
- Collaborate with other learners so you can succeed together

The only money that Free Learn will receive is through ads and donations. There is no obligation for you to pay for anything.
